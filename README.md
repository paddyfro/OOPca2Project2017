# OOPca2Project2017
# Overview for this assignment:
-You are required to develop a library application to store items of your choice such as movies, books, CDs, films, football players, or actors.  
-There should be at least two different types of items. For example Books and Films.    
-Each item in the library must contain at least four properties. For example, a book might include Title, ISBN, Author, description and genre.  
# Basic functionality of application:
 Add items to the library  
 Remove items from the library  
 Edit any property of an item in the library  
 Search for items in the library: This must allow the user to search by at least two of the properties of the item you have defined. For example, you should be able to search for books by title or author.  
 Sort items in the library by any of the items’ properties. When the application first loads, the library should be loaded from a text file. At least two test files must be provided as part of the final submission. When items are changed (Added, Removed or Edited) the text file should be updated to reflect the changes made. 
# Technical Specification in the final solution must include the following technical elements:
 A custom class to represent items in your library.  
 There should be at least 2 sub-classes of this class representing different types of items.  
 An appropriate container to store the items (e.g. ArrayList).  
 Use of at least one built in algorithm (e.g. search or sort).  
 A well designed and intuitive user interface  
 You should use a Library class to store all of the items and provide functionality to interact with these items. 
In addition, marks will be awarded for students who go beyond the basic specification outlined above. Students are free to implement whatever enhancements they wish.
